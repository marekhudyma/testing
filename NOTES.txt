Mastering Unit Testing Using Mockito and JUnit

Unit tests should follow principles:
-order independent and isolated (test classes and test methods shouldn't depend on order or execution of other test).
-trouble-free setup and run (unit tests should not require a DB connection or an Internet connection or a clean-up temp directory).
-Effortless execution (unit tests should run fine on all computers, not just on a specific computer).
-Formula 1 execution (a test should not take more than a secon to finish the execution).

@Captor - creates ArgumentCaptor
@Spy - creates spy
@InjectMocks - injects mock or spy fields into the tested object automatically using a constructor injection,
setter injection, or field injection.

for measure real time execution use: JMH microbenchmarks (it worms JVM etc).

----------
@Nullable - indicator that shows that variable/result of method can be null
add everything where can be null, so it will show NPE in GUI

@NotNull - only during validation.
